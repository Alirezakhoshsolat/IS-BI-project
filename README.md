# Insect Catch Prediction Using Meteorological Data

## Description
This project focuses on predicting the number of pests (insects) caught and the occurrence of new catches using meteorological data combined with historical insect catch data from previous time intervals. It addresses two distinct tasks:
- **Regression Problem**: Predicting the number of insects caught.
- **Classification Problem**: Predicting whether new catches occur.

The project is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for data analysis, modeling, and an interactive dashboard. The goal is to provide an accessible tool for analyzing trends and making predictions based on the provided dataset.
